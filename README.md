# ONLINE COMPLAINT REPORTER
As crimes rate are unpreccedently soaring up and newspapers getting more filled with  
news of crime,robbery,riots,murders ,so indian police needs more evidence and proofs  
to take action against the accused and must be informed in time so that crimes can be   
stopped.Police also gets frustated by fake calls and wrong evidences thus making it  
more tough for them.Keeping these problems in mind ,We had made an online complaint  
reporter web app which can help police in several ways.
